I am working on the microservices which will support for the trading adivice application . I  don't want to use the fiber . So, I made my own web framework to use in my services.

Cluster is the same as the api group route. I use the fasthttp . So, speed is relatively faster than the net/http.

You can set both  API level middleware and route level middleware
